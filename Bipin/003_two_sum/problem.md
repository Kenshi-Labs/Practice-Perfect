# Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

# Example:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]

# Unit Tests:
1. Test with a valid input where a solution exists
2. Test with no valid solution
3. Test with multiple valid solutions (return any one)
4. Test with an array of length 2
