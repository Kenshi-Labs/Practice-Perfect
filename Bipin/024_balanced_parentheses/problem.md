# Check for Balanced Parentheses
Write a function that takes a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', and determines if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if:
1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

## Example:
Input: "()[]{}"
Output: true

## Unit Tests:
1. Test with a valid string of parentheses
2. Test with an invalid string of parentheses
3. Test with an empty string
4. Test with a string containing only opening brackets
