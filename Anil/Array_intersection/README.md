Implement a function that takes two arrays as input and returns a new array containing the elements that are common to both arrays. The output array should not contain duplicates.

Example:
Input: nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2, 3]
Output: [2]

Unit Tests:

1. Test with arrays having common elements
2. Test with arrays having no common elements
3. Test with empty arrays
4. Test with arrays containing duplicate elements
