Problem 5: Longest Common Prefix
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

Example:
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

Unit Tests:

1. Test with an array of strings with a common prefix
2. Test with an array of strings with no common prefix
3. Test with an array containing an empty string
4. Test with an array containing only one string
