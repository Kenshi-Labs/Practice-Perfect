Problem 2: Valid Anagram
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

Example:
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true

Unit Tests:
1. Test with valid anagrams
2. Test with strings of different lengths
3. Test with strings containing the same letters but different frequencies
4. Test with empty strings
