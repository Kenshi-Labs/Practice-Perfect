Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the first non-repeating character in the string.

Example:
Input: "aabbcdeeff"
Output: 'c'

Unit Tests:

1. Test with a string containing a non-repeating character
2. Test with a string where all characters repeat
3. Test with an empty string
4. Test with a string containing only one character
