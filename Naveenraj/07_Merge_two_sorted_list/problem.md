Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list.

Example:
Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

Unit Tests:
1. Test with two non-empty sorted lists
2. Test with one empty list and one non-empty list
3. Test with two empty lists
4. Test with lists of different lengths
