Array Rotation
Write a function that rotates an array to the right by a given number of steps. The rotation should be performed in-place without using extra space.

Example:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 2
Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]

Unit Tests:
1. Test with a non-empty array and positive rotation
2. Test with rotation equal to array length
3. Test with rotation greater than array length
4. Test with an empty array
