Max received a list of prices for the magical fruits over the next few days:

Day 1: $7
Day 2: $1
Day 3: $5
Day 4: $3
Day 5: $6
Day 6: $4

# Max knew he had to be smart about his purchases. He decided to keep track of two important things:

- The Lowest Price: He would remember the lowest price he had seen so far.

- The Maximum Profit: He would calculate the best profit he could make if he sold the fruit on any given day.

# The Strategy

As Max walked through the market each day, he followed this plan:

- Day 1: The price was $7. Max noted this as the lowest price so far.
- Day 2: The price dropped to $1! Max was thrilled and updated his lowest price to $1.
- Day 3: The price rose to $5. Max calculated his profit: $5 (today's price) - $1 (lowest price) = $4 profit. He noted this as his maximum profit.
- Day 4: The price was $3. Max calculated again: $3 - $1 = $2 profit, but $4 was still better.
- Day 5: The price jumped to $6. Max calculated: $6 - $1 = $5 profit! He updated his maximum profit to $5.
- Day 6: The price fell to $4. Max calculated: $4 - $1 = $3 profit, but $5 was still the best.

After the last day, Max realized that the best strategy was to buy the fruit on Day 2 for $1 and sell it on Day 5 for $6, making a maximum profit of $5.
