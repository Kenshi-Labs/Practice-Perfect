String Compression
Implement a function that performs basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. If the compressed string is not smaller than the original string, return the original string.

Example:
Input: "aabcccccaaa"
Output: "a2b1c5a3"

Unit Tests:
1. Test with a string that can be compressed
2. Test with a string that cannot be compressed (should return original)
3. Test with an empty string
4. Test with a string containing no repeated characters
