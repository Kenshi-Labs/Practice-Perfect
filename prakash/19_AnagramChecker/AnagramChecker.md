Problem 19: Anagram Checker
Implement a function that takes two strings as input and determines if they are anagrams. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example:
Input: s1 = "listen", s2 = "silent"
Output: true

Unit Tests:
1. Test with valid anagrams
2. Test with strings that are not anagrams
3. Test with strings of different lengths
4. Test with empty strings
