Problem 20: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]

Unit Tests:
1. Test with an array containing duplicates
2. Test with an array with no duplicates
3. Test with an empty array
4. Test with an array containing all identical elements
